Version 1.1 of touchpad code
Changes since 1.0:
-Each button now plays a sound for debugging purposes
-Output format changed, check output section for details
-If all buttons are pressed within 400 miliseconds, it will count as a "stop" and print out a stop value
-All debug prints removed
-Moved reset and print gesture to two different functions instead of one.
-Sequences must be at least size 2 to be printed.

Output format:
SequenceGesture : {n1....nn}
where nn is  1 < n < 5, and the numbers are not seperated by spaces
Stop gesture: {9}
